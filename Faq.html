		<h3> <a id="Playlists">Playlists</a></h3>
		
		<b>- M3U Playlist importing/exporting </b> <br />
		BlackPlayer has Playlist importing, its available in the Playlist page at the bottom, click on 'Import'.<br />
		Currently only .m3u and .m3u8 is supported. The import/export feature comes without any warantees.<br />
		Playlists can also be exported to the .m3u format. The absolute paths are currently used in the resulting playlist and may not work on other devices than your phone and using BlackPlayer. <br />
		If you don't like BlackPlayer's importing/exporting there are 3rd party app in the Store that can do it also, try use them. <br />
		
		More technical info on M3U: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U</a> <br />
		If you have problems with importing, try using different file managers, you should also try using the build-in File selector, long press on the 'Import' button. <br />
		<br />
		To Export a Playlist, long press on the Playlist you want to Export and select 'Export' from the list. The playlist will be exported in .m3u file to the root of the Internal storage. <br />
		You can also try switching to the New custom Audio library, this is done in Advanced settings.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- I get 'Error Adding to Favorites'!</b> <br />
		Switch to the new Custom Audio library in Advanced Settings. This does not have this problem.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Playlists keeps disappearing! Playlists are emptied after restarted phone.</b> <br />
		The Playlists comes without any guarantees, you should keep your important Playlists backed-up using BlackPlayer or 3rd party app.<br />
		If you lost all of your Playlists you can try restore from backup, by tapping on the top 'PLAYLISTS' title and then hit the 'Restore from Backup' button.<br />
		The Playlists may be cleared/deleted automatically by the Android system when you unmount the SD-card, restart your device or add new music. <br />
		This is not a bug of BlackPlayer, instead its your device that does this, you can report this bug to your device manufacturer.<br />
		If you are going to unmount the SD-card and want the Playlists safe you can Export all Playlists by tapping on the 'PLAYLISTS' title 
		at the top and selecting 'Export all Playlists'.<br />
		The Playlists are then stored in the Playlist folder in BlackPlayer folder on the External storage.<br />
		For a quick solution to this problem, switch to the new Custom Audio library in Advanced Settings. This does not have this problem. BlackPlayer will switch to this soon.<br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- How to remove Tracks from a Playlist?</b> <br />
		Tracks from a Playlist can be swiped removed. This is the same for the play-queue except that it can only be left swipe removed. This swipe remove can also be disabled in Interface settings.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Where is the Recently Added tracks playlist?</b> <br />
		The Recently Added tracks are located in the "Playlists" section of the application.<br />
		Swipe left edge to open sliding menu, select "Playlists", swipe then left until you reach the "Recently Added" page. <br />
		Its located after "FAVORITES" page. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- I keep seeing empty playlist! Empty Playlist appear even though I have deleted them before.</b> <br />
		You most likely have a .m3u playlist file that Android keeps importing, if it has 0 tracks it failed to import it fully. <br />
		Located the .m3u (or .m3u8) file(s) (usually have the same filename as the playlist title) and delete it. <br />
		You can also add a .nomedia file in the folder to prevent the scanner from scanning that folder. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<h3><a id="Library">Library, Missing Tracks, Use as Ringtone</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Why cannot I see my tracks stored on SD-card? Scan my SD-card? How to update Library? I cannot see my newly added Tracks!</b> <br />
		Try restart your phone, it might take a while for the tracks to be scanned. Also BlackPlayer is not in charge of scanning your audio files, it uses the build-in music library which is managed by your phone.<br />
		The "Music Scanner" build-in in BlackPlayer only hands over files to the build-in scanner. <br />
		Also the Music cannot be stored on certain folders, if you cannot see your Music, try moving them to the 'Music' folder. <br />
		Also check if there is a .nomedia file in the folder of the music and delete it if so. <br />
		Also you can try switch to the new Custom Audio library in Advanced Settings. This works much better.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- How to hide Tracks (voice recordings, notifications) from my library?</b> <br />
		* Try enabling 'Hide Short Tracks' in Settings -> Metadata, and make sure 'Show All Audio files' is disabled.<br />
		* Adding a '.nomedia' file in the Folder of the Tracks you want to hide will cause the Scanner to skip it. However this might take time until the scanner picks up this change, you can speed up the process by moving(or renaming) the folder.<br />
		* BlackPlayer EX has blacklisting option where you can hide Tracks and Folders of choice from being displayed. <br />
		You can also switch to the new Custom Audio library, this allows you to manually select Music folder and more control over scanning. Switch to this in Advanced settings.<br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- How to add Tracks? Exclude folders from Library? Select Music folder.</b> <br />
		BlackPlayer by default uses the build-in Music library, therefore no excluding or including can be done. The Android system on your device manages the library and is shared amongst other Music players.<br />
		If you really want to exclude folder. The Paid (EX) version can blacklist folders. <br />
		The music scanner scans and adds new Tracks automatically. It might take a while for the tracks to appear. It is recommended that you use the 'Music' folder to store Music.<br />
		You can also switch to the new Custom Audio library, this allows you to manually select Music folder and more control over scanning. Switch to this in Advanced settings.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Is there a way to force rescan (recreate) the Library from scratch? I see duplicate tracks in the library!</b> <br />
		You can try to re-scan the library by entering Phone Settings -> Apps -> System -> Media Storage -> Clear Data. Then reboot. <br />
		Note!! Everything will be rescanned from scratch, that includes All photo-Images, Ringtones, Alarms, Audio and all Playlists, i.e. some or all of these might be lost. However no files will be deleted.<br />
		Doing this might also fix the issue of duplicate tracks. <br />
		The 'Media Storage' app might be called something else if you have any other language than English. <br />
		If you can't find it you might need to enable 'Show System apps' in an overflow (3dots) icon. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- The Tracks in my Album have wrong sort order!</b> <br />
		* Check the Track Album number for each track if they have the correct value, long press on the Track, select 'Edit'.<br />
		* Make sure the sorting is 'Album Track number', change in the top right corner when browsing an Album. <br />
		* Check that the Disc field is correct. Remove the Disc field if the Album only have one disc. Tracks with no disc are sorted first. <br />
		* Disable 'Merge Albums' in Settings -> Metadata, merged Albums might cause problems with sorting. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- My two Albums has been merged together! My 'Greatest hits' (or something else) album consist of two Artists. How to split them up? How to split up my 2 CD Album?</b> <br />
		Disable 'Merge Albums' in Metadata settings and your Albums should be separated. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Please add "set as Ringtone option". How can I set a Track as a ringtone? </b> <br />
		Enable "Ringtone Track option" in Interface -> General -> More..  <br />
		Then long-press on the track and select 'Use as Ringtone'.  <br />
		
		<br />	
		
		<b>- How to play Music that I buy from Google Play</b> <br />
		The easiest way is to open https://play.google.com/music/ on your computer. From there you can download your music to your computer as MP3 files (Note that this can only be done twice per track).<br />
		Connect your device to the computer and transfer them as regular MP3 files to your music collection folder. <br />
		<br />
		The tracks downloaded from the Google Music Android app are stored in \Android\data\com.google.android.music\files\music and contains no tag information. They need to be moved in order to BlackPlayer to detect them.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		
		<b>- Blacklisting is not working. How to Blacklist (hide) music? </b> <br />
		This feature is only available in BlackPlayer EX.<br />
		Make sure 'Enable Blacklisting' is turned on in Metadata settings. <br />
		Go to the main 'FOLDERS' view in Library, long press on the Folder you want to Blacklist, select 'Add to Blacklist'
		from the list. The Tracks in the Folder will then be added to the blacklist. <br />
		You can also blacklist single Tracks by long-pressing on them and selecting 'Add to Blacklist'.<br />
		In order to hide the Albums and Artists of the blacklisted Tracks, you must start a 'Auto Blacklist Artists & Albums' in Metadata settings.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- The tracks in the main 'TRACKS' list are not sorted correctly. Ignore 'the' or 'a' when sorting. </b> <br />
		The issue with wrong sorting, usually resolves itself after awhile or restarting your devices.<br />
		If you want a quickfix you can try enabling 'Force A-Z sorting' in Advanced Settings. <br />
		By default the sorting ignore 'a' and 'the' words, if you do not like this you can also try enabling 'Force A-Z' sorting.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- What is the 'Custom Audio Library' and why should I use it?</b> <br />
		This is brand new audio library that is customly made to fit BlackPlayer needs for reliability and performance.<br />
		It fixes issues with Playlist, Favorites and dissappearing Album covers.<br />
		In addition more features will be available when using this also over time.<br />
		Playlists will not be removed when you unmount(remove) your SD-card however they will be removed if you uninstall or clear app data of BlackPlayer since they are stored within the app. Playlists backups are by default run in the background.<br />
		To enable the Custom audio library, Enter Advanced Setting and Enable 'Beta Test New Library'. This will enable the 'Audio Library' tab found in the left sliding menu. Enter there and enable the new library.<br />
		The new library also fixes issues with 'Error Adding to Favorites'<br />
		
		<br />
		
		
		<b>- How can I change the startpage of the Library? </b> <br />
		This option is only available in the paid version. In the paid version: Settings -> Interface -> Library -> Startpage.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<h3><a id="AudioFormat">Supported Audio formats, Crossfading, Equalizer, Gapless</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Why is not Crossfading supported/working on my device?</b> <br />
		The crossfading is not supported on devices running Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 800 series and higher, due to the audio hardware decoder. All other devices should be supported. However if you are using Bluetooth audio crossfading should work fine. 
		The issues with crossfading is the reason why the features is included in the free version.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Gapless is not working on my device! Gapless troubleshooting.</b> <br />
		- Same issue as the crossfading, Gapless is not working on some devices due to the build-in audio hardware decoder. However if you are using Bluetooth audio Gapless should work fine.<br />
		- Make sure the tracks are optimized for gapless playback. I.e. there should be no pauses in sound between the two tracks.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Playing Music does not work. Playback not working. Strange issues with playing music</b> <br />
		Check that you have Crossfading disabled, this does not work on many devices. Most users have issues with this.<br />
		Try restart BlackPlayer and your device.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- The volume jumps up for a second when changing to a new track. </b> <br />
		This is a known bug and its caused when you have both crossfading and some sound-effects enabled. Turn off one of them.<br />
		All sound-effects must be turned off for the crossfading to work properly. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- I get 'Hardware Error' or 'Bass boost not supported' when using Equalizer or Bass Boost </b> <br />
		This is caused due to hardware or software issue on your device. There can be many different problems that can cause this. <br />
		- The sound effect might already in use by other program. If you have system global Sound effects try disabling them.<br />
		- Restarting your device solves the issue in many cases.<br />
		- If you are using a Custom ROM the Sound effects might be broken.<br />
		- Try changing to the 'Stock Equalizer' in Audio Settings.<br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Add support for additional audio types? Add Support for WMA? (Musepack, alac, Opus, cue etc.)</b> <br />
		Since BlackPlayer uses the build-in audio decoder from your phone, the supported formats vary between manufactures and android version and BlackPlayer cannot add additional support. <br />
		For a complete list of supported audio formats: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html#core">http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html#core</a> <br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Why cannot I see the Loudness Enhancer (Amplifier) ? Amplifier do not work on my device!</b> <br />
		The Amplifier only works on Android 4.4+ and newer. It is not guaranteed to work on all devices, Its up to the hardware manufacture to implement it. 
		Sometimes Amplifier only works using headphones and not the build-in speaker. It also might not work on custom ROMs.<br />
		
		<br />	
		
		<b>- The Volume Spikes (very loud) after turning the Equalizer on (or resuming music)! The volume is increased suddenly! </b> <br />
		This is a known bug in Android. Use the Stock (build-in) Equalizer instead. Change it in Audio settings -> Select Equalizer. Or dont use BlackPlayer equalizer at all. <br />
		Many Motorola devices are known to have this bug.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Please add support for ReplayGain, Pitch control & Tempo/playback speed control </b> <br />
		BlackPlayer currently uses the build-in audio decoder on your device and this does not support of these features. <br />
		To add these features BlackPlayer needs to switch to its own audio decoder, but there are no current plans to do so. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Shuffle mode keeps turning off.</b> <br />
		Playing a Album, Artist, Playlist or Genre (Pressing Play button in) currently turns off Shuffle. (Might change in later versions). Shuffle might be turned off in other cases, its an issue im trying to resolve.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- The previous track button should reset the track to 0! How does the "Previous Track mode" work?</b> <br />
		The setting is called 'Previous Track mode' and is available in Settings -> Audio -> scroll down abit. It has two modes: <br />
		"Fast" (Default): Pressing previous track button (<<) jumps directly to the previous track. <br />
		"Classic" : Resets the track if 3 seconds has passed on the track, otherwise move to the previous track.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- How does the sorting works?</b> <br />
		The main Track list, Artist tracks and Genre tracks can be sorted many ways. The current sorting affects all of the tracks list. For example selecting a specific Genre track sorting applies to all Genre tracks no matter the genre. <br />
		The Playlist track sorting are Playlist individual and are permantent. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- My external Lyrics-app, Lockscreen-app, Scrobbler is not working!</b> <br />
		Enable "Broadcast Now Playing" in Metadata settings.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Music is Stops when Screen is turned Off. Directly or after some while.</b> <br />
		This is caused by your device enters power saving mode and stops BlackPlayer from running in the background. You should add BlackPlayer to the whitelist of you can find such a feature on your device. If you are using extra power saving mode 'Stamina mode' for example try turn that off.<br />
		Also check if you have any external power saving app that might kill BlackPlayer while its running in the background.<br />
		<br />
		If you are using a Huawei device, this is called 'Protected Apps' in the Battery Manager and you should whitelist BlackPlayer there.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Music stops when Application is removed from Recent apps!</b> <br />
		Enable "Persistent Service" in Advanced Settings. This feature might not work on all devices, OnePlus devices is known to not work well. <br />
	
		<br />
		
		<b>- Play music when playing games. Don't pause music on notifications. Music is paused when playing Games.</b> <br />
		Change 'Audio focus level' in Audio Settings -> More.. to 'Ignore All'. 
		Remember to change it back when you are done, BlackPlayer will otherwise continue to Play on incoming notifications and while playing videos.<br />
	
		<br />		
		
		<b>- Music Start when I connect my phone to a Bluetooth device (Car stereo)!</b> <br />
		Disable 'Media Button Remote Start' in Settings -> Audio -> General -> More...<br />
		Your bluetooth device sends out a 'Play' command when connected and BlackPlayer will ignore this if it is not running. <br />
	
		<br />			
		
		<b>- Equalizer turns off immediately after leaving the Equalizer page! </b> <br />
		Try turning off the "Fix Equalizer turning off" in Audio Setting. You can also try using the Stock Equalizer instead in Audio settings, this usually works much better. <br />
		
		<br />

		<h3><a id="Lyrics">Lyrics</a></h3>
		<b>- How do I show Lyrics? The 'Lyrics' button is missing in Now Playing, how to get it back?</b> <br />
		Tap on the Album cover in Now Playing page to show the "Quick Actions". Tap on "Lyrics" or long press on any action and select "Show Lyrics" if you cannot see the 'Lyrics' action.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- How do I embed Lyrics?</b> <br />
		BlackPlayer can embed lyrics manually from the Tag edit dialog in each track or from the "Edit Lyrics" quick action. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- What Lyrics are supported?</b> <br />
		BlackPlayer supports embedded and external lyrics. The external lyrics should have the same filename as the music file but with .lrc file extension and in the same folder.<br />
		BlackPlayer supports both synchronized and unsynchronized lyrics. Read more about .lrc file format here:<br />
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)</a><br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Please add support for online lyrics! </b> <br />
		This is difficult to add since most lyrics databases are copyrighted and requires expensive licenses which I cannot afford. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- I cannot embedd my Lyrics! 'Cannot write to File' Error! </b> <br />
		Some audio files might not be able to insert lyrics due to damaged tags. <br />
		(Android 4.4) Tracks stored on the SDCard cannot be edited (inserted with Lyrics.<br />
		(Android 5.0+) You must grant write access to your device, you can do this in Advanced Settings -> 'Select SD-card'. 
		Point to the root of your SD-card. <br />
		<br />
		Here is an external link on how to Select an sd card: <a href="https://metactrl.com/docs/sdcard-on-lollipop/">https://metactrl.com/docs/sdcard-on-lollipop/</a><br />
		
		<br />
		
		
		<h3><a id="AlbumArtist">Album Artist support</a></h3>
		<br />
		
		<b>- Please add support for "ALBUM ARTIST" tag. Where do I enable the "Album Artists"?</b> <br />
		BlackPlayer uses the build-in music library, and the build-in music library unfortunately does not support the "ALBUM ARTIST" tag/table. <br />However you can switch to the new 'Custom Audio Library' in Advanced Settings that supports this feature! Try it out!<br />
		If you want to reduce the number of Artists, I recommend you to enable 'Hide Small Artists', found by tapping on the ARTISTS title, or in Metadata settings. <br />
		<br />
	
		
		
		<h3><a id="Lockscreen">Lockscreen</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Where is the lockscreen support? I don't see any. The lockscreen is not working! Custom lockscreen?</b> <br />
		Lockscreen controls is unfortunately only supported on some Android 4.0+ devices and manufactures. BlackPlayer uses the standard media remote controls same as other applications.<br />
		Your device manufacture must implement the support for the lockscreen to be able to use it.<br />
		* Huawei and Samsung is known to not support the music lockscreen widget, other than their own music app.<br />
		As of BlackPlayer Free 2.35 or EX 20.29 you can use the Custom lockscreen. Activate it in Remote settings. <br />
		The permission 'Draw over other Apps' (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) must be enabled for it to work. Check this if it does not work for you.<br />
		<br />
		
		<b>- I just Updated to (or I am running) Android 5.0 Lollipop and my Lockscreen controls is missing. </b> <br />
		Lockscreen controls is removed in Lollipop, the Notification is used instead.<br />
		Sometimes the notification might not be visible due to Androids new notification privacy setting. Change the "When device is locked" setting in "Sound & notification" to any other than "Don't show notifications at all". <br />
		If you see a "BlackPlayer" "Content hidden" notification, this is due to the new notification privacy setting. <br />
		<br />
		
		<h3><a id="AlbumCover">Album Cover</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Album covers keep disappearing (gets removed) (after reboot). </b> <br />
		This is a known bug with the album cover management for some phone models.<br />
		The Album cover management comes without and guarantees and for a more permanent solution 
		you should place the image file in the same folder as the Album, and name it 'cover.jpg' or something similar.<br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- The images in the Notification, Widget, Lockscreen (or Album list) is showing the wrong image!</b> <br />
		Sometimes the thumbnails get wrong image, you can delete the thumbnails to in Settings > Metadata > Delete Thumbnails. 
		New correct thumbnails will then be created. This only affects Album thumbnails, and not the image in Now Playing.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- All tracks in an Album get the wrong image. (image of another Album) Albums get SAME cover.</b> 
		<br />
		If a track does not have an image it usually get the image from the folder or from the same Album. Make sure the Album tag is correct.<br />
		Separate each Album by folder and place the Album cover as an image in each folder.<br />
		Check the folder for an image, if one cover.jpg file is placed in the folder of many albums, all of these might get this image as Album cover.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Can I set Album covers per Track instead of per Albums. </b> 
		<br />
		The Album covers are currently connected to the Album that the Track has. If you want Track unique Album covers you have to split up the Track from the Album (by changing the Album title) 
		and then manually change the cover of the new Album. <br />
		<br />
		
		<b>- How to disable Artist images? I want to prevent downloading of Artist images. </b><br />
		Disable 'Internet Content' in Metadata settings and Artist images will not auto download.<br />
		The downloaded images are stored in the BlackPlayer folder on the Internal Storage.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<h3><a id="Translation">Translation</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Why is BlackPlayer not available in my language? The translations are bad or contains wrong words.</b> <br />
		oneskyapp is used to manage the translations and everyone is allowed to help out with the translations.<br />
		<br /> Help here: <a href="http://blackplayer.oneskyapp.com/" >http://blackplayer.oneskyapp.com/</a> <br />
		If you encounter the use of bad words or trolling users email the developer asap. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<h3><a id="TagEditing">File Tag Editing / Delete</a></h3>
		
		<b>- My file cannot be edited? Error!? </b> <br />
		Some music files have damaged ID3 tags and cannot be edited. <br />
		(Android 4.4 Only) Music files stored on the SD card might not be edited due to Android limitations. Google "SD card fix Android 4.4" for more info. <br />
		(Android 5.0+) Users must grant BlackPlayer write access and thus allowing tag editing and delete music. Can be accessed in Advanced settings. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- My tags keeps resetting back.</b> <br />
		See above answer. Most likely due to cannot write to file. This issue however could happen on other cases also, unknown cause.<br />
		If you recently made changes you can verify that the changes are saved with the ID3 Tag viewer found in Advanced settings. This fetches new tag data from the file directly. <br />
		Also check above question if the file is stored on the SD-card.<br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		
		<b>- My Lyrics does not get updated! My Tracks are not deleted!</b> <br />
		Some music files have damaged ID3 tags and cannot be edited, but in most cases its due to Android 4.4+ changes.<br />
		(Android 4.4) Music files stored on the SD card might not be edited (or deleted) due to Android limitations. Google "SD card fix Android 4.4" for more info. <br />

		<h3><a id="Permissions">Permissions</a></h3>
		
		<b>- Why does the paid (EX) version requires to listen to my microphone?</b> <br />
		The Microphone permission is only for the visualizer to listen to the audio, if you are not using it you can block the permission if you are able to do so. <br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Why is Phone call permission required?</b> <br />
		The phone call permission is to be able to know when someone is calling you so BlackPlayer can pause and resume the music. Most of the audio players have this permission.<br />
		Most of the permissions in BlackPlayer can be blocked by 3rd party app without crashing or disabling BlackPlayer.<br />
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Why does BlackPlayer required to start when phone is started? Why require BOOT_COMPLETE permission?</b> <br />
		Blackplayer will only automatically start if you have enabled "Analog Autostart", it is required for that to work. <br />
		
		
		<br />
		
		<b>- Why require SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (or Draw over other Apps) permission?</b> <br />
		This is required for the custom Lockscreen and floating mini control to work.<br />
		If you are not using any features you may block this permission. <br />
